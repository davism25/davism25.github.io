# Hunger For Knowldege

#### Resume and Background of Mitch 

1. **Education**

   Throughout my career I have done a lot to gain my knowledge in finance. Starting out I managed multi-million dollar prices of gear for military aircraft maintenance, learning what it truly meant to manage larger amounts of money and came to the thought of why learn to manage but not have money of my own working for me.
   

   At the thought of what I could do for my money to work for me I started college and I am currently working on my Bachelors in finance. With college I also began attending any finance class offered and getting all the certifations I could get in the military. This was all in my hunger for knowledge.
