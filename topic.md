#### The Importance

Going through every day, wether it’s buying food or paying rent, everyone deals with money on the day to day. 


While dealing with your money, coming in and going out, it is important to have a good understanding of even just the basic of finance. In your understanding do not rush, just start at the basics of learning to track where your money is going and when. Once you know that you can begin to draft an idea of a budget. In anyone’s life, your budget will be your base in getting back to the basics.


#### Stepping Out of the Red

When you hear of anything in the realm of finance being in the red, you can generally process that it’s not good. In getting yourself out of the red, I mean getting yourself out of debt and to the standpoint that you can begin learning and applying your money to work for you. Many people make the common mistake of begging to invest and save in large amounts while still in debt. This can be a win for the persons state of mind but isn’t making them money in the long run. When you are still in debt you want to know what to look for when it comes to saving, and that’s good but wait. 

In talking about waiting to save while debt is still hanging over your head **I am not** saying that you don’t need a rainy day fund or emergency fund. An emergency fund can prove crucial in getting many people and families through unexpected expenses. But in turn I am saying to have that emergency fund and hold off on further investing and saving due to the interest rate comparison. Generally but not the same for all loans and credit cards, the interest rates are higher than the rates you can receive from certificates and savings accounts.

When getting out of the red just remember your 20$ earned can be 200$ lost if you invest and save first.
